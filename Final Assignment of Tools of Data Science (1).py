# ### Arithmetic Expression Examples
# 
# An arithmetic expression is a combination of numbers, variables, and operators that represents a mathematical calculation. The operators in an arithmetic expression can be addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (**).
# 
# Here are some examples of arithmetic expressions:
# 
# * 5 + 2
# * 10 - 3
# * 2 * 3
# * 10 / 2
# * 2 ** 3
# 
# These expressions can be evaluated to produce a numerical value. For example, the expression `5 + 2` evaluates to 7.
# 
# 

# In[6]:


a=5
b=10
c=a+b
d=a*b
print(c)
print(d)
print(c+d)


# ### Convert Minutes to Hours

# In[8]:


min=120
hours=min//60 
print(hours)
